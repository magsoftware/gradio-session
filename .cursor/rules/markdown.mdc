## Pattern matching

These rules apply when generating or editing Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdc`).

### Markdown Formatting Rules

When generating Markdown files:

- Use (`-`) for bullet lists.
- Wrap lines at 100 characters where possible.
- Place code blocks using triple backticks with language annotations.
- Always add empty trailing lines at the end of files.
- Always format tables in GitHub-compatible format.
- Avoid passive voice; keep sentences short.
- Titles must be in Title Case.
- Bold key terms using **double asterisks**.
- Do not auto-generate table of contents unless explicitly requested.
- Always put a single empty line before and after bullet lists.
- Always put a single empty line before and after numbered lists.
- Always put a single empty line before and after code blocks.
- Do not use icons.
